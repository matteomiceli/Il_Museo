        content: `The painting is probably of the Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini, 
        the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, and is in oil on a white Lombardy poplar 
        panel. It had been believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; 
        however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. It was 
        acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French 
        Republic itself, on permanent display at the Louvre, Paris since 1797.`
